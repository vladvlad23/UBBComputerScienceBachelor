; Write a program in the assembly language that computes the following arithmetic expression, considering the following data types for the variables:
; a - byte, b - word
; (b / a * 2 + 10) * b - b * 15;
; ex. 1: a = 10; b = 40; Result: (40 / 10 * 2 + 10) * 40 - 40 * 15 = 18 * 40 - 1600 = 720 - 600 = 120
; ex. 2: a = 100; b = 50; Result: (50 / 100 * 2 + 10) * 50 - 50 * 15 = 12 * 50 - 750 = 600 - 750 = - 150
